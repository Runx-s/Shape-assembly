Human-swarm interface is an easy-to-use Matlab (R2020a) implementation for designing desired shape, which allows the user to either load a predesigned image or manually draw one in the workspace. 

The interface provides users with the follow function settings.

- Grid scale of the workspace. There are three options for user selection, namely ’sparse’, ’normal’, and ’dense’, corresponding to the grid size 20 × 20, 60 × 60, and 100 × 100.
- Gray level used for gray transformation. The user can input the gray level h to be set in the edit box, and then click the ’setting’ button to complete the setting.
- Size of mouse brush. There are also three options for user selection, that is, ’small’, ’medium’, and ’big’. The option ’small’ means that the brush size is 1 grid, and the other two correspond to 5 and 10 grids, respectively.
- Color of mouse brush. The user can choose to draw black or white in the workspace. Recall that the desired shape is represented by the black grids while the white grids are invalid background. 

Note that the ﬁrst two settings are must be set by the user and the last two are required only for manual drawing. When all parameters are set, you can click the "Load" button to generate a gray grid.
