This file is the source code of our paper "Mean-shift exploration in shape assembly of robot swarms". It is coded by Matlab (R2020a). 

This file contains 16 m files and 1 folder.

- MainLoop.m is the main program, which is used to set simulation parameters, start/stop simulation and animation.
- Fcn_NegotPositState.m and Fcn_NegotOrientState are used to negotiate position and orientation of the target formation.
- Fcn_CalEnteringCmd, Fcn_CalExplorationCmd, and Fcn_CalInteractionCmd are used to calculate shape-entering, shape-exploring, and interaction velocity commands, respectively.
- Fcn_GetNeighborSet is used to calculate neighboring set, and Fcn_GetPerformMetric is used to calculate performance metrics.
- Lib_InitialFunctions, Lib_ShapeFunctions, Lib_UpdateFunctions, Lib_AnimatFunctions, Lib_DrawingFunctions, and Lib_RecordFunctions are used for simulation initialization, shape processing, robot motion update, animated simulation, curve drawing, and data record.
- The folder "ShapeImage" contains 4 different shapes, including snowflake, starfish, letter "R", letter "O", and letter "B".

Note that simulation parameters may need to be readjusted depending on the swarm size and shape type.
